# Liri-Node-App
This is a Siri-like app designed to display recent tweets from Twitter, songs from Spotify, and the OMDB API.

Current version:

* Missing functionality for searching for Spotify tracks and feeding results back to user
* Inoperable due to missing code and agreements between .txt files and liri.js app.

Future work to be completed:

* Fix broken Twitter search
* Complete Spotify search functionality
